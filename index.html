        <ul id="faq-list">
            <li class="question">
                Why do we need more skateparks?
                <p>
                    There are many reasons our community would benefit from more skateparks! Skateparks are a place of belonging for people who might not fit into team sports. They are especially beneficial to kids; they provide a way for them to be active and creative outside, require little planning/scheduling for parents, and have a low cost of entry. Kids also make friends and learn social skills at the skatepark.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other sports and recreation facilities have received consistent funding over time, but the skatepark has not received any investment in 20 years. We hope to change that with an extension to the existing Skatepark of Athens (SPOA). We also hope to increase community accessibility and engagement with skateparks by advocating for them to be built in more locations around Athens Clarke County. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li class="question">
                What's wrong with the skatepark we have?
                <p>
                    The kids and beginners of Athens deserve a place to skate/ride that is accessible and safe for beginners, i.e. with smaller obstacles. The current skatepark could be discouraging and scary for them, leading them to quit a sport they might otherwise love. ACC has also neglected the skatepark for years to the point that it is unsafe and outdated.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li class="question">
                Is it really ever going to happen?
                <p>
                    It has taken many years to get the ball rolling because we weren't organized. Now, we are organized. We have a strong core group of people working together to make it happen. We're an official, registered 501(c)(3). We have a roadmap. We have a deadline. We have a fundraising goal of $100,000. We have been in contact with county officials and they are supportive and excited to work with us. We can do this!
                </p>
            </li>
            <li class="question">
                When is it going to happen?
                <p>
                    Our goal is to have the new extension in motion by the 20th anniversary of the Skatepark of Athens: April 19, 2025.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li class="question">
                What will the new skatepark look like?
                <p>
                    The extension of SPOA will be focused on street skating; obstacles will include ledges/boxes, rails, stairs, ramps, and quarter pipes. These obstacles will be smaller than those at the existing park, making the extension much more beginner friendly. It will also be more modern, keeping up with newer trends in skateparks that bring people from all over to try them out.
